\usage{
make_page_size(
  width = NULL,
  height = NULL,
  units,
  asp = NULL,
  orientation = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  dims = NULL,
  valid_units = NULL,
  cols = c("width", "height"),
  class = "data.frame",
  call = caller_env()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{width, height}{Page width and height. Both are required, if asp is
\code{NULL}. Default to \code{NULL}.}

\item{units}{Units for width and height. Required unless units is included in
dims. Passed to \code{\link[=as_unit_type]{as_unit_type()}} to validate.}

\item{asp}{Aspect ratio. Required if only one of width or height are
provided.}

\item{orientation}{Page orientation, Default: \code{NULL}. Supported options are
"portrait", "landscape", or "square". If width and height suggest a
portrait orientation when orientation = "landscape", the dimensions are
reversed so the page dimensions match the provided orientation.}

\item{name}{Optional name for paper size. Recommend avoiding duplication with
existing names in \code{paper_sizes}.}

\item{dims}{A list or data.frame that can be used to set width, height,
units, and/or asp.}

\item{valid_units}{Character vector with name or symbols for valid units.
Defaults to \code{NULL} but any other unit name or symbol, e.g. "px", is
permitted.}

\item{cols}{Column names to use for width and height columns. Defaults to
c("width", "height"). Must be length 2 and the first value is always used
as as the width name and the second as the height.}

\item{class}{Class of return object: "data.frame" (default) or "list" (only
supported when input page size is a single row).}

\item{call}{The execution environment of a currently running
function, e.g. \code{call = caller_env()}. The corresponding function
call is retrieved and mentioned in error messages as the source
of the error.

You only need to supply \code{call} when throwing a condition from a
helper function which wouldn't be relevant to mention in the
message.

Can also be \code{NULL} or a \link[rlang:topic-defuse]{defused function call} to
respectively not display any call or hard-code a code to display.

For more information about error calls, see \ifelse{html}{\link[rlang:topic-error-call]{Including function calls in error messages}}{\link[rlang:topic-error-call]{Including function calls in error messages}}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns named (by default) width, height, units,
orientation, and asp or a list with those same names.
}
\description{
Width and height or aspect ratio and either width or height are required.
Units are also required. If orientation is provided, width and height may be
reversed to match the provided orientation.
}
\examples{
make_page_size(48, 24, "in", name = "Tabletop map")

make_page_size(8.5, 8.5, "in", name = "Trimmed letter")

make_page_size(5, asp = 1.25, units = "cm", class = "list")
